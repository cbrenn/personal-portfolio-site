      I am currently a student at Ada Developers Acadmey. I enjoy traveling, yoga, dance, solving problems and subversive art.

      In the past I've worked in a Title VI funded center at the University of Washington, encouraging outreach and education around East Asia. In line with that, I was awarded a full year scholarship to live in Beijng and study Mandarin through the Chinese government.

      I spend alot of time writing music,mostly through Reason software, but have composed a few pieces in Chuck. Talk to me about lyrics and abstract musical complexities, currently all about the ambient sound poetry.
    </p>
     Looking forward to continuing my study of programming, dance, music and meditation. For my professional future, I have grand visions of non profits, machine learning, blockchain and finance.    Stay tuned.
